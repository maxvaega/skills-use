- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality criteria met

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: The spec successfully avoids mentioning Python classes, LangChain APIs, or filesystem implementation details. All requirements are expressed in terms of "MUST scan directory", "MUST parse YAML", etc. without specifying how.

✅ **User value focused**: Each user story clearly articulates the developer's need and the value delivered. For example, "progressive disclosure is a core architectural principle that differentiates this library" explains WHY metadata-first loading matters.

✅ **Non-technical audience**: While the domain (Python libraries, LangChain) is technical, the specification describes WHAT users need without HOW to build it. A product manager could understand the requirements without coding knowledge.

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully populated with concrete details.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No clarification markers**: The specification contains zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All decisions have been made based on the MVP plan document, with reasonable defaults documented in the Assumptions section.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each functional requirement is testable:
- FR-001: "MUST scan the `.claude/skills/` directory" → Test by creating directory and verifying scan occurs
- FR-020: "MUST complete metadata loading in under 500ms for 10 skills" → Test with performance measurement
- FR-023: "MUST replace all occurrences of `$ARGUMENTS`" → Test with multiple placeholder instances

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All 8 success criteria include specific metrics:
- SC-001: "under 500ms for 10 skills" (time-based)
- SC-004: "70% test coverage" (percentage-based)
- SC-005: "within 5 minutes" (time-based)
- SC-006: "100% of the time" (accuracy-based)

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not implementation:
- ✅ "Developers can discover all skills... in under 500ms" (not "filesystem scan completes")
- ✅ "LangChain agents can successfully use skill tools" (not "StructuredTool.invoke() returns string")
- ✅ "The library handles edge cases... with clear error messages" (not "exception handling catches all errors")

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each of 6 user stories includes 2-5 Given/When/Then scenarios (total: 20 scenarios covering all critical paths)

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 9 edge cases documented covering empty files, malformed YAML, missing directories, multiple placeholders, name conflicts, permission errors, etc.

✅ **Scope boundaries**: Clear "In Scope" (9 items) and "Out of Scope" (12 items with deferral versions) sections eliminate ambiguity about what v0.1 includes.

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions**: 12 assumptions documented (Python version, skill location, format, performance targets) and 6 dependencies listed (PyYAML, LangChain, pytest, etc.)

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Requirements have acceptance criteria**: All 50 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories. For example:
- FR-001-006 (Discovery) → User Story 1 acceptance scenarios
- FR-007-014 (Parsing) → User Story 5 acceptance scenarios
- FR-021-028 (Invocation) → User Story 3 acceptance scenarios

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: 6 prioritized user stories (4 P1, 2 P2) cover the complete vertical slice:
1. Discovery → Find skills on filesystem
2. Metadata access → Progressive disclosure pattern
3. Invocation → Content processing
4. LangChain integration → End-to-end value
5. Parsing → Format validation
6. Examples → Adoption enablement

✅ **Measurable outcomes defined**: Success criteria section provides 8 concrete metrics to validate feature completion, all aligned with MVP goals from the vertical slice plan.

✅ **No implementation leaks**: Specification correctly describes entities (SkillMetadata, SkillManager) as conceptual models, not Python classes. Dependencies mention "LangChain" as a framework, not specific imports or APIs.

## Notes

- The specification is comprehensive and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
- No clarifications were needed because the MVP plan document provides detailed scope boundaries
- All assumptions from the vertical slice plan (Week 4 deliverables, 70% coverage target, sync-only operations) are correctly captured
- The progressive disclosure pattern is consistently emphasized as a core architectural principle
- Edge cases are well-documented, particularly around `$ARGUMENTS` substitution (resolves OP-5 from original PRD)

## Recommendation

**PROCEED TO PLANNING** - This specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation tasks.
