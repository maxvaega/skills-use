## Executive Summary

## skills-use

The **skills-use** library is a Python framework that implements Anthropic's Agent Skills functionality, enabling LLM-powered agents to autonomously discover and utilize packaged expertise. The key expected functionalities include:


### Discovery & Loading
- **Multi-Source Skill Discovery** (FR-1): Automatically discovers skills from personal directories (`~/.claude/skills/`), project directories (`./skills/`), plugins, and custom paths
- **Flexible Directory Structures**: Supports both flat (root-level) and nested skill hierarchies
- **Plugin Integration** (FR-7): Reads Anthropic plugin manifests and discovers skills bundled within plugins

### Parsing & Management
- **SKILL.md Parsing** (FR-2): Extracts and validates YAML frontmatter (name, description, allowed-tools, version, model, etc.) and markdown content
- **Skill Metadata Management** (FR-3): Maintains lightweight metadata for agent decision-making without loading full content upfront
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatically resolves name collisions using priority ordering (project > personal > anthropic > plugins)

### Intelligent Content Handling
- **Progressive Disclosure** (Core Pattern): Loads metadata at startup, full content on demand, supporting files on-demand—minimizing context window usage
- **Skill Invocation** (FR-4): Loads full content, injects base directory context, and substitutes arguments (`$ARGUMENTS` placeholder support)
- **File Reference Resolution** (FR-5): Enables agents to access supporting files (scripts, templates, docs) within skill directories using relative paths
- **Script Execution Support** (FR-6): Bundles executable scripts (Python, Shell, JavaScript) within skills for deterministic operations

### Security & Control
- **Tool Restriction Enforcement** (Core): Parses `allowed-tools` frontmatter and restricts agent access to only permitted tools during skill execution
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: Validates file paths stay within skill directories
- **Error Handling & Logging** (FR-8): Categorized errors (discovery, parsing, validation, invocation) with informative messages

### Framework Integrations
The library provides adapters for five major agent frameworks:
- **LangChain** (IR-2): Converts skills to `StructuredTool` instances with restriction enforcement
- **LlamaIndex** (IR-5): Creates `FunctionTool` instances for ReActAgent and FunctionAgent patterns
- **CrewAI** (IR-6): Generates `BaseTool` subclasses with Pydantic schema validation
- **Haystack** (IR-3): Creates custom ComponentTools for pipeline integration
- **Google ADK** (IR-4): Converts skills to ADK-compatible function tools

### Model-Agnostic Design
- Framework-agnostic core with zero framework dependencies (IR-1)
- Usable standalone without any agent framework
- Supports both synchronous and asynchronous execution patterns

---

## Market Analysis

### Who Is This Library For?

**Primary Users:**
- **LLM Application Developers** building agents with LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, Haystack, or Google ADK frameworks
- **Enterprise Teams** deploying multi-LLM systems (Claude, GPT, Gemini, open-source models) with unified skill management
- **Skill Library Authors & Contributors** creating reusable agent capabilities for community consumption

**Use Case Spectrum:**
- Solo developers rapidly prototyping agents with modular skills
- Enterprise organizations standardizing tool/capability distribution across teams
- Open-source communities building shared skill repositories

### Challenges It Solves

1. **Context Window Efficiency**: Traditional function-calling presents all available tools upfront, consuming valuable context. Skills-use implements *progressive disclosure*—agents see skill metadata initially, load full instructions only when relevant, accessing supporting files on-demand.

2. **Multi-Framework Fragmentation**: Developers choosing LangChain, LlamaIndex, or CrewAI face incompatible tool interfaces. This library provides a single skill definition format (Anthropic-compatible SKILL.md) with automatic translation to each framework's native tool types.

3. **Security & Access Control**: Unrestricted agent tool access creates security risks. Skills-use enforces granular tool restrictions per skill—an image-processing skill can restrict access to file I/O tools while allowing Bash execution.

4. **Skill Organization & Distribution**: Agent capabilities traditionally live scattered in framework-specific code. Skills-use enables modular, discoverable skills organized in standard directory structures, simplifying composition and reuse.

5. **Anthropic Compatibility Gap**: Anthropic's native SKILL.md format is tightly coupled to Claude Code. This library decouples skills from the Claude ecosystem, enabling any LLM framework to leverage the Anthropic skill ecosystem.

### Why People Should Use It

✅ **100% Anthropic Compatible** – Existing SKILL.md files work unchanged; leverage the entire Anthropic skill repository without modification.

✅ **Framework-Agnostic Core** – Write skills once, use them everywhere. Switch between LangChain, LlamaIndex, and CrewAI without rewriting capability definitions.

✅ **Performance-Optimized** – Progressive disclosure keeps context windows lean (~100ms discovery for 100 skills, <10ms invocation overhead).

✅ **Enterprise-Ready** – Built-in security (path traversal prevention, tool restrictions), comprehensive error handling, and production-grade async/sync support.

✅ **Low Adoption Friction** – Pure Python, minimal dependencies, optional framework integrations. Drop into existing projects with `pip install skills-use`.

✅ **Model-Agnostic Future** – Design supports Claude, GPT, Gemini, and local LLMs. Plan multi-LLM strategies with a unified skill layer.

In essence, **skills-use democratizes Anthropic's advanced skill architecture**, making it accessible to the broader agent community while solving the real problem of building secure, efficient, reusable capabilities that work across any LLM platform.

### The MVP

**Ship a working LangChain integration in 4 weeks**, then iterate based on real user feedback.

### Core Principle

> "A startup's job is to learn what customers want as fast as possible, not to build perfect software in isolation."

## Vertical Slice Philosophy

### What is a Vertical Slice?

A vertical slice cuts through all layers of the system to deliver one complete, narrow feature:

```
Traditional Horizontal Approach (Original Plan):
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 1: Core Discovery & Parsing   │ ← Phase 1 (6 weeks)
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 2: Features & Plugins         │ ← Phase 2 (3 weeks)
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 3: Framework Integration      │ ← Phase 3 (3 weeks)
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓
    First working product: Week 12


Vertical Slice Approach (This Plan):

```

### Benefits for Skills-use

1. **Early Validation**: LangChain users can test in week 4, not week 12
2. **Risk Reduction**: Validate core assumption (progressive loading value) early
3. **Flexible Scope**: If week 4 reveals issues, pivot before investing 12 weeks
4. **Momentum**: Shipping creates energy, builds community, attracts contributors
5. **Better Architecture**: Real usage reveals design issues early when they're cheap to fix

### What Gets Cut from MVP?

**Deferred to v0.2:**
- ❌ Async support (sync only in v0.1)
- ❌ Plugin integration (single directory only)
- ❌ Tool restriction enforcement (all tools allowed)
- ❌ Multiple search paths (./skills/ only)
- ❌ Comprehensive documentation (README only)
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline (manual testing only)
- ❌ 90% test coverage (70% is acceptable)
- ❌ Performance optimization (just make it work)

**What MUST work in Week 4:**
- ✅ Discover skills from ./skills/ directory
- ✅ Parse SKILL.md with frontmatter
- ✅ Load skill metadata without full content
- ✅ Invoke skill with argument substitution
- ✅ Create LangChain StructuredTool from skill
- ✅ End-to-end example: Agent uses skill to solve task
- ✅ Published to PyPI

## Revised Requirements Structure

### Requirements Reorganization

[Original PRD](PRD_SKILLS-USE_LIBRARY.md) has **28 requirement categories**. Vertical slice focuses on **7 critical paths**.

### v0.1 Critical Path Requirements (Week 1-4)

#### CP-1: Basic Skill Discovery
**Original**: FR-1 (Full), TS-2 (Full)
**Vertical Slice**: FR-1 (Minimal)

**Scope:**
- ✅ Scan `.claude/skills/` directory only (hardcoded path)
- ✅ Detect `SKILL.md` files (case-insensitive)
- ✅ Support flat structure: `.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`
- ❌ No nested structure support
- ❌ No custom paths
- ❌ No plugin support
- ❌ No `./skills/` support

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Discovers all skills in `.claude/skills/` directory
- Returns list of skill paths
- Handles missing directory gracefully (empty list)

**Why support the claude directory?**
- Guarantees full compatibility with original functionality
- helps quickly compare agent results
- the structure will be supported later, more directories can be added in later versions

**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours

---

#### CP-2: Minimal SKILL.md Parsing
**Original**: FR-2 (Full), TS-1 (Full)
**Vertical Slice**: FR-2 (Minimal)

**Scope:**

- ✅ Parse optional field: `allowed-tools` (but don't enforce)
- ✅ Extract markdown content after frontmatter
- ❌ No field validation beyond required/missing
- ❌ No version field parsing
- ❌ No model field parsing
- ❌ Ignore `disable-model-invocation`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Parses valid SKILL.md correctly
- Raises clear error if `name` or `description` missing
- Returns SkillMetadata object

**Estimated Effort:** 6 hours

---

#### CP-3: Lightweight Metadata Management

- ❌ No typed input schemas
- ❌ No error handling beyond basic exceptions

**API Design:**
```python
from skills_use import SkillManager
from skills_use.integrations.langchain import create_langchain_tools

manager = SkillManager()
tools = create_langchain_tools(manager)

# Returns list of LangChain StructuredTool objects
# Agent can now use skills as tools
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

## Comparison: Original vs Vertical Slice

### Timeline Comparison

| Milestone | Original Plan | Vertical Slice | Difference |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| First usable product | Week 12 | Week 4 | **-8 weeks** |
| LangChain integration | Week 12 | Week 4 | **-8 weeks** |
| PyPI publish | Week 12 | Week 4 | **-8 weeks** |
| Plugin support | Week 9 | Week 10 | +1 week |
| v1.0 production release | Week 12 | Week 12 | Same |

**Key Insight**: Both approaches reach v1.0 at Week 12, but vertical slice delivers value 8 weeks earlier.

## Conclusion

### Why This Plan Works

1. **Early Validation**: Real user feedback at week 4, not week 12
2. **Agile Principles**: Ship value early, iterate based on feedback
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Fail fast if idea doesn't resonate
4. **Momentum**: Shipping creates energy and community
5. **Flexibility**: Can pivot after v0.1 if needed
6. **Same Destination**: Still reach v1.0 at week 12

### The Commitment

This plan requires discipline:
- ✅ **Say no to scope creep**: v0.1 scope is fixed
- ✅ **Ship imperfect software**: 70% coverage is OK for v0.1
- ✅ **Defer perfection**: Documentation site can wait until v1.0
- ✅ **Trust the process**: Users will guide v0.2+ development

### The Payoff

**Week 4**: You have a working product with real users
**Week 12**: You have a production-ready v1.0 shaped by real feedback
**Week 24**: You have a thriving community and multiple framework integrations

## Next Steps

1. **Review this plan**: Ensure you understand and agree with the approach
2. **Resolve OP-5**: Make the $ARGUMENTS edge case decision (30 minutes)
3. **Week 0 validation**: Conduct user interviews and community feedback
4. **Start Week 1**: Begin implementation with confidence

**Good luck shipping your vertical slice! 🚀**
